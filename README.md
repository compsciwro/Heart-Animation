# 💗 Heart Drawing with Python Turtle
This playful little project uses Python's turtle graphics module and math functions to draw a heart shape on the screen. It’s a light-hearted, artistic use of code — perfect for beginners exploring graphics or anyone wanting to make something cool with just a few lines of Python!

## 💻 Preview
The program draws a continuously looping heart curve in pink on a black background using parametric equations.

## 📜 How It Works
The heart is drawn using the parametric equations:
- 𝑥 = 15 ⋅ sin^3(𝑘)
- y = 12 ⋅ cos(k) −5 ⋅ cos(2k) −2 ⋅ cos(3k) − cos(4k)<br>

These equations plot a symmetrical heart shape, scaled up for better visibility in Turtle Graphics.

## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Run the script using:
- python heart.py
Watch the turtle draw a heart in real time!
